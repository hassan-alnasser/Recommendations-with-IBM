## 1. Project Overview

In this project, I'll apply a data science approach to analyze disaster data from <a href="https://www.figure-eight.com/" target="_blank">Figure Eight</a> to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

_data_ directory contains a data set which are real messages that were sent during disaster events. I will be creating a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that appropriate disaster relief agency can be reached out for help.

This project will include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.

[Here](#eg) are a few screenshots of the web app.
